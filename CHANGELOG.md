# Noctalum Changelog

## v0.35 — 2026-05-22 — New-QSO time field becomes a date-and-time picker

- `<input id="q-time">` switched from `type="time"` to `type="datetime-local"` so the optional time field now exposes a date as well — back-log a QSO that happened on a different day without leaving the form
- Form submit assembles `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` (UTC) directly from the input instead of stitching it together from a separate `dataset.date` field
- Edit flow pre-fills both date and time from the QSO's UTC timestamp

## v0.34 — 2026-05-22 — Mobile mode (auto-engages on phones)

- New `body.mobile-mode` class auto-applied when `navigator.userAgent` matches a mobile device or the viewport is ≤640 px wide
- Override in Settings → Display: **Auto** (default) / **Desktop** / **Mobile**, persisted to `localStorage['noctalum.displayMode']`
- `?mode=mobile` / `?mode=desktop` URL flags force the respective mode for testing
- Topbar: compact (logo + brand + station pill + tabs + logout); back-pill, op-badge, feature-request, station-id and rig detail are hidden
- QSO entry form: single-column grid with 44 px-tall inputs (16 px font to prevent iOS focus zoom); only `data-qso-pinned` fields plus mode + band are shown by default, a "+ More fields" button reveals the rest, and the expansion auto-collapses after each log
- QSO history table: tighter padding, sticky first column when scrolling horizontally, full-width filter input
- Ops panel: hidden inline; replaced by a fixed bottom-bar nav (Status / Stash / Cluster / Chat / Objective) that opens the matching pane as a full-screen sheet. ESC closes the sheet; tapping the same nav button toggles. iOS safe-area-inset honoured.
- Bottom-sheet uses the existing pane elements (re-parented), so all WebSocket-driven content (chat, stash badge, cluster spots) keeps working without duplicate state

## v0.33 — 2026-05-22 — Ops-panel tabs wrap to a second row when narrow

- `.ops-tabs` is now `flex-wrap: wrap` and each `.ops-tab` is `flex: 0 0 auto; white-space: nowrap`
- When the right sidebar is too narrow to fit Status, Stash, Cluster, Chat and Objective in one row, the overflowing tabs flow to a second row instead of overlapping past the panel border

## v0.32 — 2026-05-22 — Chat tab framed (input pinned at bottom)

- Chat input and Send button stay pinned at the bottom of the panel
- Tab header stays at the top; only the message list scrolls
- Previously the whole right panel scrolled when many messages accumulated, pushing the input out of view

## v0.31 — 2026-05-22 — Stash tab for in-flight QSOs (auto-stash on TRX QSY)

- New "Stash" tab in the ops panel between Status and Cluster
- When a callsign has been entered and the selected TRX moves to a different frequency (≥ 100 Hz shift), the in-flight New QSO entry is automatically stashed: all field values are captured along with the *old* frequency, and the form is cleared (as if ESC had been pressed)
- Click a stashed entry to retune the TRX to the stashed frequency and refill the form with the captured values (including custom fields)
- If the New QSO form already has data when a stash is recalled, the current contents are auto-stashed first
- Stashes are scoped per user + contest, persisted server-side (new `qso_stashes` table), and synchronised across all of a user's browser tabs via WebSocket
- New per-contest setting "Auto-delete stashed pre-QSOs after (minutes)" — default 60, settable from the contest settings modal
- Manual edits to the frequency input do not trigger a stash; only TRX-reported changes do

## v0.30 — 2026-05-22 — Fix band dropdown and notes field case in New QSO form

- Band selector in New QSO now correctly shows "20 m", "70 cm" etc. (CSS specificity fix)
- Notes field no longer forced to uppercase (same fix)

## v0.29 — 2026-05-22 — SSB/USB/LSB treated as same mode for duplicate detection

- USB and LSB are now normalised to SSB when checking for duplicate QSOs
- Affects the duplicate badge above the callsign field and the band-pill colour coding

## v0.28 — 2026-05-22 — Harmonized band label capitalization

- Band unit is now displayed with a space and lowercase: "20 m", "70 cm", "2 m", etc. everywhere (dropdowns, band pills, QSO table, stats, rig display, operator list, cluster filter, conflict banners)
- Internal band identifiers (stored in DB, API) are unchanged

## v0.27 — 2026-05-22 — Back-to-overview pill, station pill opens contest settings

- Contest view topbar: new slim "← Back to overview" pill below the Noctalum logo navigates back to contest selection
- Clicking the station pill (center topbar) now opens the contest settings modal instead of navigating away
- Read-only users see all contest settings with greyed-out fields and no save button

## v0.26 — 2026-05-22 — "What's New" dialog on version update

- Track the last app version each user acknowledged; show a "What's New?" dialog listing missed changelog entries on login or page refresh
- German translations now consistently use informal "du" instead of formal "Sie"

## v0.25 — 2026-05-22 17:00 UTC — Fix chat history loading on contest entry

- Chat message history now loads reliably when entering a contest
- Root cause: the WebSocket was reused from a previous connection, so the server never sent the history replay for the new contest
- Fix: WebSocket is now force-reconnected each time `enterApp()` runs, causing the server to replay recent chat messages for the current contest

## v0.24 — 2026-05-22 16:00 UTC — Notes no-caps, configurable log columns

- Notes field no longer forced uppercase (CSS override for `#q-notes`)
- Contest edit modal: draggable log-column picker below the WYSIWYG editor
  - Toggle visibility (Visible/Hidden pill) for each QSO field + custom fields
  - Drag rows to reorder columns
  - Configuration saved in contest as `log_columns` JSON (backend DB column added)
  - QSO history table headers and cells rendered dynamically from this config

## v0.23 — 2026-05-22 15:30 UTC — QRZ settings moved to Global Settings

- QRZ.com credentials removed from Personal Settings
- QRZ fieldset added to Global Settings with username, password, and test-connection button
- One shared QRZ account is now used for all server-side callsign lookups

## v0.22 — 2026-05-22 15:00 UTC — Fix chat sounds, remove Settings tab

- Fixed crash: stale `updateChatSoundToggleBtn` call was throwing a ReferenceError, breaking `showContestScreen` and silently disabling chat sounds
- Settings tab removed from the contest view topbar

## v0.21 — 2026-05-22 14:30 UTC — Chat sound mute consolidated into Personal Settings

- Chat sound mute button removed from the contest picker start page
- Replaced by a toggleable pill (with icon) in Personal Settings, left-aligned inside the card

## v0.20 — 2026-05-22 14:00 UTC — Auto-band from frequency, topbar cleanup

- Three apps listed: Rig Control Helper GUI, Rig Control Helper CLI, and WSJT-X Bridge
